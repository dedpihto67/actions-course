GitHub Actions offers workflow that can build the code in your repositories and run the associated tests. GitHub Actions gives you the flexibility to decide what events trigger a CI workflow. Maybe you desire a schedule or want to test every time code is pushed to your repositories, GitHub Actions can easily be configured to support these scenarios and more.

Once your CI testing is complete, the results of each test will be reflected directly in the pull request. This gives you immediate visibility into the impact the current branch has on your code base. Branch protection rules can be configured which require some, or all, of your CI tests to pass prior to allowing pull requests to me merged.

üí°GitHub-hosted runners come ready to work with your code right out of the box. Check out [the preinstalled software](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners) available to use for your workflow!

When you set up CI in your repository, GitHub analyzes the code in your repository and recommends CI workflows based on the language and framework in your repository.

Using Node.js? GitHub will suggest a workflow template that installs all of your Node.js packages and executes your included tests. You can use this template as is or customize it to your own unique needs. This template is not required, and you are completely free to write your own custom workflow files to run your CI tests however you see fit!
