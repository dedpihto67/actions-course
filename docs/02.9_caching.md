## Caching with Actions {docsify-ignore-all}

Sometimes our workflows require us to pull down a large number of dependencies.  As the time to download these dependencies goes up we can think about [caching them close to the Actions Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) to speed up your run time.  

Take a look at [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache) for samples
Sample Maven Workflow:

```
- name: Cache local Maven repository
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.m2/repository
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
```

Things to keep in mind about caching on GitHub.com  
- 5GB Max cache size per repository
- 7 Day data retention
- Scoped to key and branch
- Avoid caching sensitive data
