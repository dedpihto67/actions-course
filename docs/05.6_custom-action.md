# Toolkits, tips, tricks for writing custom actions {docsify-ignore-all}

## JavaScript actions library

When writing JavaScript based actions it is incredibly useful to leverage the [GitHub Actions toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit). This toolkit comes packed with functions to perform a wide range of tasks.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **core**

Useful when managing inputs, outputs, results, logging, secrets and variables.

Installation: `npm install @actions/core --save`

#### **exec**

Allows execution of CLI tools and is capable of processing the output.

Installation: `npm install @actions/exec --save`

#### **glob**

Provides a set of functions that make searching for files matching a glob patterns easy to use.

Installation: `npm install @actions/glob --save`

#### **io**

Need to perform disk related tasks such as copying, moving or deleting files? If so, this is the package for you.

Installation: `npm install @actions/io --save`

#### **tool-cache**

Provides functions for downloading and caching tools.

Installation: `npm install @actions/tool-cache --save`

#### **github**

If interaction with your repo through the GitHub API is likely, this package provides you will an Octokit client that is fully hydrated to the current action context.

Installation: `npm install @actions/github --save`

#### **artifact**

Provides functions that interact with artifacts.

Installation: `npm install @actions/artifact --save`

## Workflow commands for GitHub Actions

If you are running shell commands or writing a Docker container action there is a set of workflow commands available to you. These commands can be a part of your `workflow.yml` files or source code in your custom actions.

Each function in the `@actions/core` tookit package has an equivalent workflow command. Let's look at how them map together now:

| Toolkit function    | Equivalent workflow command                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| core.addPath        | add-path                                            |
| core.debug          | debug                                               |
| core.error          | error                                               |
| core.endGroup       | endgroup                                            |
| core.exportVariable | set-env                                             |
| core.getInput       | Accessible using environment variable INPUT\_{NAME} |
| core.getState       | Accessible using environment variable STATE\_{NAME} |
| core.isDebug        | Accessible using environment variable RUNNER_DEBUG  |
| core.saveState      | save-state                                          |
| core.setFailed      | Used as a shortcut for ::error and exit 1           |
| core.setOutput      | set-output                                          |
| core.setSecret      | add-mask                                            |
| core.startGroup     | group                                               |
| core.warning        | warning fil                                         |

**Using these commands in a workflow**

```yaml
- name: Set selected color
  run: echo '::set-env name=USER_NAME::Mona'
- name: Get color
  run: echo 'The selected color is' $USER_NAME
```

**Using commands as a part of a Python based Docker container action**

```python
def select_random_fact(fact_arr):
    return fact_arr[random.randint(0, len(fact_list)+1)]


random_fact = select_random_fact(fact_list)

# Set the output of the action as the value of random_fact
print(f"::set-output name=fact::{random_fact}")
```

### GitHub Script

A really useful action that exists is called [GitHub Script](https://github.com/actions/github-script) and its main purpose is to allow you to use the GitHub API through Octokit directly in your workflow files without the need to package and manage a complete custom action.

Take a look at this quick example of using GitHub Script

```yaml
on:
  issues: { types: opened }

jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/github-script@0.9.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          script: |
            github.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: 'ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for reporting!'
            })
```

At first glance it may seem as though a workflow files accepts the Octokit JavaScript library. It is important to note that this **is not** the case, and rather you are passing raw text to an action located at `actions/github-script@0.9.0`.

<p class="custom-info-box">
It's also worth noting that this action is under active development and many things can change, so use at your own risk.  We will show you this action in action... pun intended, regardless of it's development state.</p>
