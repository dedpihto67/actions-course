## Action Types {docsify-ignore-all}
GitHub Actions are open source repositories written in a [variety of languages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions).  

### [Docker Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action)
Actions can be written with Dockerfiles so you can utilize any language and environment that your step needs.
Sample `action.yml` for a Docker action:

```
# action.yml
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone and record the time'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:  # id of input
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  time: # id of output
    description: 'The time we greeted you'
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
```

### [Node Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action)
Traditional Actions are written in Node.  They can utilize any language that can compile in to Javascript, so many of them are written in Typescript and compiled into a `index.js` file.
GitHub provides [helper libraries](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) that allow you to interact with the Actions context and the GitHub API easily.

### [Composite Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action)
Finally you can now write Shell scripts and treat them like actions.  
Sample `action.yml`:

```
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:  # id of input
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  random-number:
    description: "Random number"
    value: ${{ steps.random-number-generator.outputs.random-id }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: echo Hello ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}.
      shell: bash
    - id: random-number-generator
      run: echo "::set-output name=random-id::$(echo $RANDOM)"
      shell: bash
    - run: ${{ github.action_path }}/goodbye.sh
      shell: bash
```
