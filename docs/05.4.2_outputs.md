## Outputs {docsify-ignore-all}

This is an **optional** parameter used when your action needs to pass data to another action later in the workflow. Consider an action that makes a specific HTTP request and needs to send the response of that request to an operation later in the workflow chain. This is where **outputs** come into play.

Like **Inputs** the **outputs**of an action get declared in the `action.yml` like below:

`action.yml`

```yaml
outputs:
  res:
    description: response object from super fancy HTTP request
```

**outputs** get named, in the above scenario that name is `res` and they have one parameter which is `description`.

As you expect, actions can have more than one output and defining them is as easy as adding to the **outputs** block.

`action.yml`

```yaml
outputs:
  res:
    description: response object from super fancy HTTP request
  anotheroutput:
    description: see, you really can use more than one output
```

<p class="custom-info-box">
<b>description</b> is required if you plan to define outputs for your action.
</p>

Let's take a look ðŸ‘€at how to use **outputs** from the workflow side of things.

`workflow.yml`

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My first step
    uses: our/custom-action@v1
    id: step1
  - name: My backup step
    uses: any/action-expecting-input@v1
    with:
      expectedinput: ${{steps.step1.outputs.res}}
```

Take notice that the `expectedinput` uses a specific output named `res`. It was in the `action.yml` file that `res` was defined. So like **inputs**, we can check the `action.yml` file for any given action to see what kind of outputs this action is capable of passing down throughout your workflows.
