GitHub Actions enable custom software development life cycles to be created alongside the existing source code in your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions allow you to:

- Run a custom workflow triggered by ANY GitHub event
- Run simultaneous tests across multiple operating systems and runtimes
- Use GitHub-hosted runners for every major operating system or use self-hosted runners on premises or in the cloud
- Run workflows directly in a virtual machine
- Run workflows inside of containers
- Build applications in your language of choice with versatile language support
- View real time workflow logs and easily share CI/CD failures
- Architect container orchestration using docker-compose
- Automate workflows quickly using starter workflows
- Share and consume actions in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
- Get email notifications about workflow runs
