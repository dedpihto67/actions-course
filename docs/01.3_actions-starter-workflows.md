## Starter Workflows {docsify-ignore-all}

If all of that sounds intimidating have no fear, GitHub provides you with many **starter workflows** to help you get moving with GitHub Actions.

_These, and many more, can be found by exploring the **Actions** tab within a repository._

GitHub also allows you to create [**your own starter workflows for your organization**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization).
