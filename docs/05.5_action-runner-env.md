## What's in a runner? {docsify-ignore-all}

GitHub-hosted runners are virtual machines provided to you that execute your workflows. These machines grant you administrative privileges regardless of the operating system you are running on. This includes using `sudo` without a password for Mac and Linux machines.

**Environment Variables**

A wide range of environment variables are included in each runner. It is recommended to use these environment variables if possible for a more consistent experience.

These variables are available to every step in a workflow run and steps are capable of reading, creating, or modifying environment variables.
