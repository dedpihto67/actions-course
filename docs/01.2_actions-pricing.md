## Usage Limits <p style="font-size:.4em; display: inline">\*subject to change

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Job execution**

# 6 Hours

After 6 hours the job is terminated and is seen as a failed job. This limit does not apply to self-hosted runners.

#### **Workflow run**

# 72 Hours

Reaching this limit will cancel the workflow. This limit also applies to self-hosted runners.

#### **Job queue**

# 24 Hours

If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.

**This limit does not apply to GitHub-hosted runners.**

#### **API requests**

# 1000 per hour

You can execute up to 1000 API requests in an hour across all actions within a repository. If exceeded, additional API calls will fail, which might cause jobs to fail. This limit also applies to self-hosted runners.

#### **Job matrix**

# 256 per run

A job matrix can generate a maximum of 256 jobs per workflow run.

**This limit also applies to self-hosted runners.**

#### **Concurrent jobs**

# Based on Plan

The number of concurrent jobs you can run in your account depends on your GitHub plan. There are no concurrency limits for self-hosted runners.

**See table below**
